1) Understanding Depth Maps:
 	- Gain a clear understanding of what depth maps are and how they are typically generated from stereo image pairs. Depth maps represent the distance information of objects in a scene.

2) Gather Stereo Image Pairs:
	- Collect or generate a set of stereo image pairs. These are pairs of images of the same scene taken from slightly different viewpoints, simulating how human vision perceives depth through binocular vision.
	
3) Preprocessing:
	- Load the stereo image pairs using OpenCV.
	- Convert the images to grayscale if they are in color. Depth estimation is often done on grayscale images.
	- Ensure that the images are rectified. Rectification ensures that corresponding points in the left and right images lie on the same scanline.
		- can only be done in a test environement

4) Feature Detection and Matching:
	- Use feature detection algorithms (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB) to find key points in both images.
	- Compute descriptors for these key points to describe their local neighborhoods.
	- Match the keypoints between the left and right images based on their descriptors.

5) Estimate Disparity:
	- Using the matched keypoints, estimate the disparity between corresponding points in the left and right images.
	- Disparity represents the apparent shift in position of an object between two images and is inversely proportional to depth.

6) Compute Depth Map:
	- Given the estimated disparity values, calculate the depth map.
	- Depth can be computed using the formula: Depth = Baseline * FocalLength / Disparity
	- Baseline: Distance between the camera centers.
	- Focal Length: Focal length of the camera.
	- Disparity: Disparity value for the corresponding pixel.

7) Visualization and Evaluation:
	- Visualize the depth map using OpenCV's visualization tools.
	- Evaluate the accuracy of the depth map by comparing it with ground truth data if available.

8) Refinement and Optimization:
	- Experiment with different feature detectors, descriptors, and matching algorithms to improve the accuracy of the depth map.
	- Optimize the code for efficiency, especially if working with large image datasets.

9) User Interface (Optional):
	- Develop a user interface to make the tool more user-friendly.
	- Allow users to select stereo image pairs, visualize depth maps, and adjust parameters.

10) Documentation and Testing:
	- Document the code thoroughly, including explanations of algorithms and usage instructions.
	- Test the tool extensively with various stereo image pairs to ensure robustness and accuracy.
